# Bsy - A backend for idl hands
The phrase "The devil makes work for idle hands to do" has been around for centuries, but
its meaning can still be applied in a modern context. Finding yourself worrying without cause, 
your mind wandering to darker corners, and your body pacing as you try to out-walk the shadows 
chasing you are all common feelings to those who struggle with anxiety, depression, attention
deficit disorders, and other mental health challenges. With any or all of those feelings taking
up space in your mind, it can be difficult to put them aside, but that gets easier when you've 
got a positive outlet for your energy.

Bsy is the backend API for the Idl video platform. It's built using Rails 6 (for now), and handles
authentication/user profiles and their associated videos. This is part of the initial commit to rename and re-repo the backend into Bsy, so more to come soon!
